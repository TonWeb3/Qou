"""
Cloudflare-proof WebSocket transport for pyquotex.

Why this exists
---------------
Quotex sits behind Cloudflare bot management, which scores the TLS/JA3
fingerprint of the client. Python's `websockets` library has an unmistakably
non-browser fingerprint, so the WebSocket UPGRADE is rejected with HTTP 403
before any authorization frame is ever sent. Measured on 2026-09-02:

    GET /api/v1/cabinets/digest   -> 200  (JSON API allowed)
    GET /pt/trade                 -> 403  (browser route blocked)
    WSS ws2.qxbroker.com          -> 403  (every host, every User-Agent)

The session itself was perfectly valid throughout - the same cookies returned
a live balance over HTTP. Re-logging in cannot fix this and only burns the
e-mail PIN; the block is on the transport, not the account.

curl_cffi replays a real browser's TLS + HTTP/2 fingerprint. With it the same
cookies, same URL and same headers connect first time:

    chrome      page=200  WS=OK -> 0{"sid":"cldLlwsHSQ3CWT5MLpGl",...}
    chrome124   page=200  WS=OK
    firefox133  page=200  WS=OK

So this module swaps ONLY the socket transport underneath pyquotex. Every
other part of the flow the bot already relies on - _on_open, _on_message,
the SSID authorization, the stale watchdog, subscription replay, reconnect
backoff - is untouched and still runs.
